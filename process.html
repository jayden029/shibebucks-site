<h1 style='color:#2f9c41;'>How It All Works</h1>
<p>Behind every powerful meme coin is a powerful process—and at ShibeBucks, we believe in <strong>transparency, community, and simplicity</strong>.</p>
<p>It all started with a fair launch. No pre-mine. No VC deals. No whales. We dropped ShibeBucks straight into the hands of the people who matter most: YOU.</p>
<p>At launch, we burned <strong>20% of the total supply</strong>, reducing overall circulation and creating instant scarcity. This burn wasn’t just symbolic—it was a signal: we’re here for real value.</p>
<p>Next, we allocated:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>26%</strong> to a liquidity pool for easy and stable trading</li>
  <li><strong>24%</strong> to community rewards and airdrops</li>
  <li><strong>20%</strong> to marketing and awareness</li>
  <li><strong>10%</strong> to development</li>
</ul>
<p>All funds are visible and traceable. We’re building with <strong>full transparency</strong>. Every move, every allocation, and every major decision goes through the community DAO. Why? Because decentralization isn’t just a buzzword—it’s the way forward.</p>
<p>Our roadmap is broken into phases, each carefully planned to maximize momentum and excitement. From staking and gaming, to NFT integrations and real-world collabs—we’re building something bigger than just a token. We’re building a platform where <strong>fun and finance collide</strong>.</p>
<p>The ShibeBucks process is simple: be transparent, empower the community, and keep the vibes high. That's how we win. That’s how you win.</p>
